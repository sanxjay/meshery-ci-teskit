# Study Guide for CI/CD, React, Vite, and TSX

This guide outlines key concepts and resources to help you understand the technologies used in this project.

## 1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

**What it is:** CI/CD is a method to deliver apps frequently to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. CI focuses on merging code changes frequently and running automated tests. CD focuses on automating the release of validated code to production.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Version Control (Git):** Essential for tracking changes and collaboration.
*   **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Build Automation:** Compiling code, bundling assets.
*   **Deployment Automation:** Releasing applications to various environments.
*   **Pipelines:** Automated workflows that run CI/CD steps.

**Resources:**
*   **GitHub Actions Documentation:** [https://docs.github.com/en/actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) (Since this project uses GitHub Actions, this is highly relevant)
*   **Atlassian CI/CD Guide:** [https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/ci-cd-pipeline-basics](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/ci-cd-pipeline-basics)

## 2. React (JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces)

**What it is:** React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Components:** Reusable UI building blocks.
*   **JSX:** A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML.
*   **State and Props:** How data flows and changes within components.
*   **Lifecycle Methods/Hooks:** Managing component behavior over time.
*   **Virtual DOM:** React's efficient way of updating the browser's DOM.

**Resources:**
*   **React Official Documentation:** [https://react.dev/](https://react.dev/) (Start with "Learn React")
*   **freeCodeCamp React Course:** [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/)

## 3. Vite (Next Generation Frontend Tooling)

**What it is:** Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It uses native ES modules for development and Rollup for production builds.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Native ES Modules:** How Vite serves code directly to the browser during development.
*   **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Instant updates without full page reloads.
*   **Bundling for Production:** Optimizing code for deployment.
*   **Plugins:** Extending Vite's functionality.

**Resources:**
*   **Vite Official Documentation:** [https://vitejs.dev/](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   **Vite GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/vitejs/vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)

## 4. TSX (TypeScript with JSX)

**What it is:** TSX is simply TypeScript files that contain JSX syntax. It combines the benefits of TypeScript (static typing for better code quality and maintainability) with JSX (for writing React components).

**Key Concepts:**
*   **TypeScript Basics:** Types, interfaces, type inference.
*   **JSX Syntax:** Writing HTML-like structures in JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   **Typing React Components:** How to add types to props, state, and events in React components.

**Resources:**
*   **TypeScript Official Documentation:** [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) (Focus on "Handbook" and "Everyday Types")
*   **React TypeScript Cheatsheet:** [https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/) (Excellent resource for combining React and TypeScript)
