  Frontend & UI:

   * Component Library: Introduce a component library like Material-UI or
     Ant Design to standardize UI components and accelerate development.
   * State Management: For more complex applications, integrate a state
     management library like Redux or Zustand to manage application state
     more effectively.
   * Internationalization (i18n): Add support for multiple languages using
      a library like react-i18next.
   * Accessibility (a11y): Improve accessibility by using semantic HTML,
     ARIA attributes, and conducting accessibility audits.

  Testing & CI/CD:

   * Visual Regression Testing: Add visual regression testing with a tool
     like Percy or Applitools to catch unintended UI changes.
   * Performance Testing: Integrate performance testing into the CI
     pipeline to monitor and prevent performance regressions.
   * Code Coverage: Track code coverage and set thresholds to ensure new
     code is adequately tested.
   * End-to-End Test Scenarios: Expand the e2e tests to cover more complex
      user workflows and edge cases.

  Backend & Architecture:

   * Mock API Server: Use a mock API server (e.g., MSW, json-server) to
     simulate API responses for more robust development and testing.
   * Containerization: Dockerize the application to create a consistent
     development and deployment environment.
   * Storybook: Implement Storybook to develop and document UI components
     in isolation.
