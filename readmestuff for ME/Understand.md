# Code Explanation

The application is a simple React-based dashboard with two main pages: **Dashboard** and **Settings**. It uses `react-router-dom` for navigation and Tailwind CSS for styling.

- **`main.tsx`**: This is the entry point of the application. It renders the main `App` component inside `React.StrictMode`.

- **`App.tsx`**: This component sets up the main layout and routing. It includes a `Sidebar` for navigation and a main content area where the `Dashboard` and `Settings` pages are rendered based on the URL.

- **`Sidebar.tsx`**: This component displays the navigation links to the **Dashboard** and **Settings** pages.

- **`Dashboard.tsx`**: This page displays a list of "deployments" and includes a button to add new ones. Clicking the "Add Deployment" button opens a modal.

- **`Settings.tsx`**: This page contains a toggle switch for "Dark Mode," although the functionality for switching themes is not yet implemented.

- **`Modal.tsx`**: This component is a pop-up form for adding new deployments.
