# E2E Test Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the `npm run test:e2e` command.

## Problem

The `npm run test:e2e` command was failing with a "navigation failed because page was closed" error. This was due to a combination of issues, including incorrect test configuration, missing browser dependencies, and incorrect element locators.

## Solution

The following steps were taken to resolve the issue:

1.  **Created a new test file:** A new test file, `tests/e2e.spec.ts`, was created to replace the existing `tests/example.spec.ts`. The new file contains tests that are specific to the application and navigate to the local development server (`http://localhost:5173`).

2.  **Deleted the old test file:** The old test file, `tests/example.spec.ts`, was deleted to avoid confusion and ensure that only the correct tests are run.

3.  **Installed Playwright browsers:** The Playwright browsers were installed using the `npx playwright install` command. This ensures that the tests have the necessary dependencies to run correctly.

4.  **Corrected locators:** The locators in the tests were corrected to accurately target the elements on the page. This ensures that the tests can interact with the application as expected.
